Euthanasia rates


Baby:        3.2%

Kitten:      4.33%

Adult:       7.29%

Older Adult: 7.657%

Midlife:     10.21%

Twilight:    18.41%


So, yeah, there's a pretty strong positive correlation between age and the odds you're gonna be euthanized.

 "I just want to take a second to point out that you're more likely to die before your owner actually comes for you. That's a "big oof". What's interesting, however, is that 5% of all the cats are euthanized and 1.36% die. Beyond that, 5% are returned to their owners and while 43% are adopted, 45.2% are transferred out of the facility."
 
Well, as for the ones that are stolen or "escape", it appears that being 6 months old or younger and a domestic shorthair are the most popular targets, with two Siamese cats being the only "breeds" involved.
