###Outcome Breakdowns


**Adoptions**          21,768

**Transfers**          19,885

**Return to Owner**    2,506

**Euthanasia**         1,834

###Euthanasia rates


**Baby:**        3.2%

**Kitten:**      4.33%

**Adult:**       7.29%

**Older Adult:** 7.657%

**Midlife:**     10.21%

**Twilight:**    18.41%


So, yeah, there's a pretty strong positive correlation between age and the odds you're gonna be euthanized.

I just want to take a second to point out that the rates of cat deaths are the same as the amount of cats returned to their owners. What's interesting, however, is that 5.26% of all the cats are euthanized and 1.34% die. Beyond that, 5.35% are returned to their owners and while 46.48% are adopted, 42.46% are transferred out of the facility.
 
Well, as for the tens that are stolen or "escape", it appears that being 6 months old or younger and a domestic shorthair are the most popular targets, with two Siamese cats being the only "breeds" involved.
