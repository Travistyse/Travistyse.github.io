There's a much larger number of cats between the age of 0 and 6 months old but there's also a large portion of cats between the ages of 6 months and a year old - which, to me, is interesting because it means that the vast majority of cats brought or born into the shelter are very young - so no wonder there's such a large push for spaying and neutering cats (beyond the eco reasons like over-hunting local wildlife and cleanliness of the environment). The other thing that this data seems to indicate is that while there is a solid amount of cats falling into the "given up for adoption or abandoned later in life" stigma, there are actually a very large number of cats which are taken in by the shelter long before they'd even have a chance to get accustomed to a home environment - which creates a demand for Fostering - a practice by which someone volunteers to temporarily take in the cat to nurse, house, and potentially even do the work of getting the cat adopted to another person or family on their own - this demand is in addition to the shelter's desire to save space, money, and human labor.

## Outcome Breakdowns


**Adoptions**          21,768

**Transfers**          19,885

**Return to Owner**    2,506

**Euthanasia**         1,834

**Died**               631

**Rto-Adopt**          119

**Disposals**          45

**Missing**            38


## Euthanasia rates


**Baby:**        3.2%

**Kitten:**      4.33%

**Adult:**       7.29%

**Older Adult:** 7.657%

**Midlife:**     10.21%

**Twilight:**    18.41%


So, yeah, there's a pretty strong positive correlation between age and the odds you're gonna be euthanized.

I just want to take a second to point out that the rates of cat deaths are the same as the amount of cats returned to their owners. What's interesting, however, is that 5.26% of all the cats are euthanized and 1.34% die. Beyond that, 5.35% are returned to their owners and while 46.48% are adopted, 42.46% are transferred out of the facility.
 
Well, as for the tens that are stolen or "escape", it appears that being 6 months old or younger and a domestic shorthair are the most popular targets, with two Siamese cats being the only "breeds" involved.
